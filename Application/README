# had to make a mongodb to make the process of using the data even easier and more efficient
# try and figure out if the mongodb being on my local host affect it going live (probably does) and try and fix it, go
# to database teacher and ask

# Mongodb might not actually be as efficient as I thought it would be because my laptop has to be the local host and if i
# want to deploy it then my laptop will have to act as a server which will be troublesome so i am writing this just to remind
# myself that it is okay to use the json file if it doesn't work out


# every time I get a new word I want to figure out how to store those words and

# to know what words we can make from the words we have sent we need a chatbot working behind the scene everytime we get a random value we add
# to our txt file what the word is and the meaning so basically, chinese - Meaning then we ask the chatbot to run through the file
# and find or estimate the amount of sentences we can make from them so the first 5 or 6 wont be that many but it should start
# picking up after that

# use some type of natural language processing model (NLPM) to figure out how many sentences can be made from all the words
# that are being sent out, so try and learn some NLPM to try and do that, actually this is not how it works but i want it
# to learn what to send next from what it has sent, i want this program to send what can make you make more sentences from
# the words you have already learned (bee sent)


# every weekday this email will be sent out, if it is not a week day then this email will not be ent out, but we will have to see
# I think sending this out every day will develop discipline for the students trying to learn this language or any language

# the email is still kind of bland and boring, so I want to make it seem more lively and try and figure out a way if
# I can make the email more interactive and fun to look at so people would want to actually study the language and would
# wait for the email

# if I can make the NLPM fit in here I want there to be a circular thing that shows there progress over the words and
# over the sentences they can make from the words, if we can make the randomizer also pick the words in the new database
# less than the new ones every time
